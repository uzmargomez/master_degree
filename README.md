# MSc Scientific Computing and Data Analysis. Durham University

Repository made to highlight some of the work I have done that could be relevant for my application to the MSc. Please consider most of my work has been used for companies I have worked with, so I cannot have some of the code I made on my personal repository and I can't make it public either.

Repositories:

- [data_structures_algorithms_and_c](https://github.com/uzmargomez/data_structures_algorithms_and_c)

    Solved exercises of the [Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cs-fundamentals). Great course, it goes through the basics of Data Structures and Algorithms, and it is also a great refresher of the C++ programming language. This specific repository is private since the solutions for the assignments cannot be made public.

- [chatbot](https://github.com/uzmargomez/chatbot)

    POC Chatbot, it can be connected to Whatsapp through Twilio. It uses the RASA Framework.

- [look_test](https://github.com/uzmargomez/look_tests)

    Face detection and recognition system, using Sparse Representation and FaceNet.

- [covid19](https://github.com/uzmargomez/covid19)

    Basic Flask application to obtain information regarding the COVID-19 spreading. It gets a prediction of the future behaviour using the SIR model, solved using the RK4 algorithm.

- [thesis_physics](https://github.com/uzmargomez/thesis_physics)

    Research project about the numerical simulation of the Vlasov Equation. The pdf document is named `thesis_uzmar.pdf`, and it is written in Spanish using LaTeX. The Fortran code is on the file `thesis_physics/code/vlasov_sphere.f90`.
    
- [curriculum_vitae](https://github.com/uzmargomez/curriculum_vitae)

    Current CV, created using LaTeX.
